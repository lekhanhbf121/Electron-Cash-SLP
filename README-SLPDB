Enable SLPDB Validation
=========================

1. Navigate to the Network options by selecting Tools, then Network.
2. Select the SLPDB Validation tab
3. Enable SLPDB

If you have existing added tokens, that are unvalidated, you may need
to restart your client before SLPDB validation will take place.

By default, all endpoints will be used, however the slider determines how many
results are needed for a token to be deemed valid. This defaults to the number
of endpoints - 1, in the case that an endpoint provided is out of date. If you
would like more or less "valid" results prior to confirmation, simply adjust
the slider.


Adding additional SLPDB Endpoints
===================================
1. Enter the slpdb endpoint in the textfield
    ex: https://slpdb.fountainhead.cash/q/

2. Click the add button
3. Confirm


Removing SLPDB Endpoints
==========================
1. Right click target endpoint you would like to remove
2. Select remove


Help, my tokens still arent validating!
=======================================
If your wallet doesnt seem to be validating, it could be running the internal 
default validation. 

Enable SLPDB in the Network menu, under SLPDB Validation and restart the client.



Help, my transactions arent showing up!
========================================
When importing a wallet, you may need to scan for additional addresses.

1. Navigate to Wallet, then Scan more addresses
2. Select how many additional addresses to scan (100 is suggested), and scan

If your transactions still arent showing up, increase the number of addresses and
scan again.



Invalid tokens
================
If for some reason tokens were marked invalid due to an endpoint not being up-to-date,
you can revalidate an invalid token by right clicking in the SLP History tab and selecting
"Revalidate".

If this valid transaction is still being marked invalid, you may need to reduce the slider in
the SLPDB Validation tab of the Network option menu, as an endpoint may not be updated.
